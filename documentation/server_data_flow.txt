//AUTHENTIFICATION STARTS:
//does the client claim to be authenticated?

//CASE: YES -THE CLIENT MAKES A CLAIM BY COOKIE (name=auth)
    The only way the server recognizes a claim is by a cookie named auth. This cookie contains an 
    encoded JWT with the required credentials. The Firebase JWT framework is in use to encode and 
    decode JWT's.
    
//--is this claim valid?
//--yes
//----load application

//--no
//----remove cookie
//----load launcher

//CASE: NO - THE CLIENT DOES NOT MAKE A CLAIM
    Without a valid auth token the server will load the launcher which enables a user to 
    authenticate the application. 

//--load launcher to make a claim.
